## Questions

Before the report, I have an important question, I am not sure whether I headed the wrong way. So when we talk about "Geneva" data, we are talking about "Geneva round 1947" right? Not "Geneva round 1956". So in the pdf file "Geneva 1", on page 2 in adobe reader, it says it was registered in "May 1950", which is the same year as in file "Annecy" page 2 "May 1950", and in the following pages both write as 1950. But the real time line should be "Geneva 1947" and "Annecy 1949". This is confusing, but I do find out that at least in the schedule 16 "Free list", the contents are different.  

If the Geneva in our previous conversation refers to file "Geneva 56", then the agreements is slightly different from the Torquay data, starting from page 218(220), there are three columns of taxes and I don't know which one I should take for our assignment. Could you help to clarify this to me. Meanwhile I will first start with the Annecy data.


## Overview

1. Based on the "Torquay All Schedule",  I think the number of ad valorem taxes and specific taxes are generally fifty fifty. Some products only have ad valorem, some only have specific. I don't see an obvious pattern, it should depend on the products.

2. Yes, I just check the original 1930 Tariff act file, the 1601-1814 are included in the section called "Free list" (schedule 16). I believe not all the products are included (but most included), for example PAR 1814 "worm gut" is not included in the Torquay round. And some paragraphs use different description, but in general, the two parts match.

3. I think for now I will not integrate the IRC part in the existing schedules, because there are only three pages of them and the products included are not many. There are none IRc products in Annecy, a few covered in Geneva (less than Torquay), which is kind of weired based on the time line.

4. For the containers, I also learned about the trade history in Australia, it says that the trade of beef, other food and also certain chemicals increases in significantly larger volumns after the development of technology. I will pay more attention to those products when taking comparisons with other agreements. Maybe there are more changes of products in later rounds like Kenedy round and Tokyo round.

5. I just compared the schedule_16 (Free list) in Annecy and Torquay, I notice that around half of the products which are in the Torquay free list are not in the Annecy. Geneva (file Geneva1) round covers similar amounts of Free list products as Torquay, but there are several covered in Torquay but not Geneva and vice versa. So several products on the Free list had been removed from Geneva to Torquay, I will manually fill them in. 

6. Given the situation in point 5, if I encounter paragraphs in other schedules that are covered in one of the agreements but not in others, I will manually put in the products. But so far I don't think we need to create a dummy variable on this because it will be straight forward if the columns in other rounds are empty. 

7. I have just started the filling in of Annecy data.
