## Overview

I have successfully finished the experiment for coding of Schedule_10 (a sub-sample I randomly chose), the result should be both readable in Excel file and accessible in Rstudio as csv data. 


## Next step

1. The replication is a reduced version which only shows exactly the words in the original pdf file. However Ross has added additional information and categories when digitizing them so my next step will be learning those elements and adding them in the manual cleaning process, and finally, combine the schedules together (if Schedule_16 is needed).

2. Meanwhile I will look into Annecy and Geneva data and try to understand the reason for no digitization you mentioned yesterday.
